<h1><marquee>HAPPY FATHERS DAY DAD</marquee></h1>
<h2><marquee width="50%">Thank you for all the piggy back rides, all the times you pretended to be a horse, and all the times you threw me into the air and caught me.
Your body might be regretting it now, but it made for a wonderful childhood.
The last thing is that you are the best DAD in the world.
